#' Construct shrub cover rasters
#' 
#' Takes RAP rasters for years 1986-2020
#'   - sum shrub and tree layer for each year
#' 
#' RAP raw data bands contain % cover for the following categories:
#'   band 1 = annual forb and grass
#'   band 2 = bare ground
#'   band 3 = litter
#'   band 4 = perennial forb and grass
#'   band 5 = shrub
#'   band 6 = tree
#'   band 7-12 = uncertainty for bands 1-6
#' no data value = 65535
