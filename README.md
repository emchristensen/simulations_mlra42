# simulations_mlra42

This aim of this project is to parameterize and run simulations of a state-and-transition model based in MLRA 42 (Southern desertic basins, plains, and mountains) which covers portions of southern New Mexico and west Texas. 

### Workflow
1. Get RAP data and trim to MLRA 42 boundary
    - See "RAP" folder
2. Estimate transition probabilities
    - See "syncrosim test run" folder
3. Run simulations using rsyncrosim
    - See "rsyncrosim" folder
