# simulations_mlra42

This aim of this project is to parameterize and run simulations of a state-and-transition model based in MLRA 42 (Southern desertic basins, plains, and mountains) which covers portions of southern New Mexico and west Texas. 

### Workflow
1. Define area of interest
    - Within MLRA 42 (shapefile of boundary in shapefile/nrcs142.2_052440)
    - Elevation (MLRA 42 ranges from 555-2735m)
