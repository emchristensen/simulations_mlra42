### Soil maps folder


This folder contains soil category raster data. Raw data was obtained from Shawn Salley from a previous project. 

__ensemble_soil_map_MLRA42.tif__ raster data file.

__soil_map_mlra42.R__ Script to create ensemble_soil_map_MLRA42.tif from raw data. Crops area to MLRA42. 

Soil categories:  
   1 = sandy  
   2 = deep sand  
   3 = loamy-clayey  
   4 = gravelly and calcic  
   5 = bedrock and colluvium  
   6 = gypsic  
   7 = bottomland  

Shawn recommends combining sandy and deep sand, as the model had difficulty distinguishing these categories and they are also functionally similar.
